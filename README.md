## Commands
All commands start with the prefix & can only be used by admins that are both set in the config | () = Required, [] = Optional
### `warn (@user) (points) [reason]`
Adds warning points to the user.
User must be mentioned (Still possible to mention with ID if user is not in the guild/server). If no reason is provided, it will set the reason to "No reason provided".

### `remove (@user) [number]` | `remove last`
User: Removes a warning from the user. If no number is specified, it will remove the users last warning, otherwise it will remove the warning from the position in their warning list. *If you wish to remove a certain amount of points, I suggest warning them with negative points*.
Last: Removes the last warning given to any user within the guild/server.

### `list (@user) [page number]`
Gets a list of warnings issued to the mentioned user. A maximum of 5 warnings will display on a page. If there are more than 5 warnings, use the page number to navigate through other pages (defaults to first page if none is specified).

### `prune (number)`
Bulk deletes the number of messages in the channel used in.
Discord only allows up to 100 bulk deleting messages. Be careful repeating this command in a short period of time.

### `ping`
üèì Table tennis and timers.

More moderation commands may be added in the future.
